## My process

This is a very easy and simple task. I have done this with raw css without using any type of third party library.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I'm participating #100DaysOfCode challenge. This is my day-1. So, I'm hopeful about working on more projects.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp) - If you are new with display flex property then you can learn from here.
